# bifrost — voice-controlled opencode

Talk or type from the phone; the code you're changing lives here. Full architecture: `README.md`.

## Map
- `pwa/` — Next.js 15 phone client. `/api/*` proxy is the ONLY seam to opencode (phone never talks to it directly).
- `agent/` — Python livekit-agents worker: STT → opencode → TTS. Room slug = session slug.
- `deploy/` — docker compose: LiveKit (host net) + speaches fallback.
- `docs/plan.md` — checklist board, work top-to-bottom. `docs/open-questions.md` — every unresolved decision lands there.

## Hardware
This box runs everything. Mac Studio serves speech models (MLX Qwen3-ASR/TTS) on the LAN — endpoint in `agent/.env` (`SPEACHES_URL`). Private IPs/hostnames/ssh: `docs/local.md` (gitignored). Tailnet-only, nothing public.

## Verify
- pwa: `cd pwa && npm run build`
- agent: `cd agent && uv run agent.py console` (local mic test)
- deploy: `cd deploy && docker compose up -d`
- services: `systemctl --user restart lk-pwa lk-agent opencode-serve`
- live diag: `tail pwa/.diag/$(date +%F).log`

## Rules
- Proceed autonomously; verify with evidence; contact user only when stuck or looping.
- No commits unless asked. Secrets stay out of git.

## Showing artifacts to the phone
The user often reads replies on the phone PWA. Make answers visual:
- To show a picture (png/jpg/webp/svg/gif): save it to `artifacts/<name>.<ext>` in this
  repo root, then reference it in your reply as a markdown image:
  `![description](/api/artifact/<name>.<ext>)` — it renders inline in the chat.
- To show a UI/mockup/page: paste it as a fenced ```html block — the phone renders it
  inline in a sandboxed frame automatically.
- Never point the phone at LAN IPs/ports; only `/api/artifact/...` links are reachable.
